# K-Means Algorithm from Scratch

## Description

This project aims to implement the K-Means algorithm from scratch using Python. The algorithm will be applied to a simulated dataset containing students' IQ (Intelligence Quotient) scores and CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) scores. The objective is to cluster students based on their academic performance.

## Features

Implementation of the K-Means algorithm in Python.

Reading the dataset containing CGPA and IQ scores.

Applying the K-Means algorithm to cluster students into groups.

Visualizing the formed clusters.

## How to Use

Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

The requirements.txt file contains the following dependencies:
- numpy
- matplotlib

## Example Dataset

The dataset used is a CSV file containing two columns:

- CGPA: Student's Cumulative Grade Point Average score.
- IQ: Student's Intelligence Quotient score.
